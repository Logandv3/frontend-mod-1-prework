## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I agree with all six points the article discusses.  I think a lot of it stems from having a positive and open attitude.  When I look back on the times where I learned best it is clear to see that my best learning was always
accompanied by a willing attitude.  I was understood that there would be challenges and I wouldn't be a master
soon after starting.  I learned that I can criticize my self in a constructive manner without being too hard on my
self.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

string: Some sort of sequence of characters.
number: Numbers and decimals.
boolean: A data type that has 2 outcomes.  true and false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// The purpose of a code comment is to explain or describe what is happening with your code.  So you or another coder can look remember or understand what or why the code is doing stuff.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a location that you can store data to be called upon later.  I would describe it as a storage unit with a sign on the front.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Various social media sites.
userName.  aboutMe.  phoneNum.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatention is adding together strings and or variables using +

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

When you enter certain info in a bio or profile and some of the info appears in a tag or flair that other users can see even when they aren't in you profile.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am still uncertain about how git works.  I kind of get what it does and the basics of how to use it, but I need to learn more about it.
