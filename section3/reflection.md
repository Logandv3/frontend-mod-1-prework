## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* I agree that people who have a growth mindset are less likely to get overly frustrated or give up.  I have always liked the idea of evaluating what weaknesses I have and approaching them instead of avoiding.  

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I think I do a decent job of working on my weaknesses.  I do think that I struggle sometimes when I am not able to do something well quickly or as easily as others do.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* I think of an app like Amazon.  There are all sorts of lists you can add to, reminders, shopping cart and probably even your recent searches are stored in an array.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array is a storage place where you can put variables or values that share some sort of similarity.  This way you can easily call upon certain info when you need it.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* A loop allows you to complete some action multiple times without having to write out the code for that action multiple times.  If you need the program to go through lists and print them or check if they meet certain conditions or take certain actions, you can use arrays with loops.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* I would explain it like a car wash vs. hand washing maybe.  If you just need to wash one car you get out your car washing supplies, wash your car and put all the supplies away when you are done.  If you needed to do this for many people in your city it would be a lot of work to travel to their house, take out your supplies, wash the car and put them away again to go do someone elses.

Instead you build a car wash that is always ready to wash a car and can run for as many cars as there are for the day.

It probably isn't the best example (especially since there are mobile car washers) but it was all I could think of right now.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* I think that using loops can get tricky so I am sure I will need practice and have lots of questions in the future.  I am also curious about using an array inside an array and what type of looping you can do with that.
