// `pop` removes that last element from an array and returns that element.  So what it sounds like it is doing is
// making an array shorter by pulling an element out and showing that value.

// `push` adds an element to the end of an array and returns the new length.  So you can add something in to an
// array if you don't need it in a specific spot or want it at the end, then it will tell you how many elements
// are in there now.

// `shift` removes the first element from an array and returns it.  So it will shorten the array by taking out
// the first element and will then show it.

// `unshift` adds one or more elements to the start of an array and returns the length.  So this will add to the
// array in the first position then tell you how long the array is.

// `concat()` adds arrays together.
