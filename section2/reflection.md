## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

* I think I tend to wait too long when I am working on my own.  In the past this has been a behavior that was reinforced a bit.  I often figure things out when I am getting close to asking a question because I think through what I am asking
and how I should ask it.  I need to be more willing to ask questions instead of needlessly fuming about something that
can be fixed pretty easy.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* I didn't mind too much.  I think the biggest struggle I had was understanding what some of the questions were actually asking me to do, thought that may just be me since reading comprehension isn't a strong suit.  It took some playing around.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* When there is more than one possible option or needs that need to be evaluated.  I am hungry so I check the fridge for food.  If there is food I will eat.  If I am missing some food I will add it to the grocery list.  If I have no food I will go to the store to buy food.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* You use if for the initial statement and condition.  After that you will you else if for multiple conditions after the initial or else if you want to execute code for any remaining conditions.  The interpreter will go through each condition, starting with the if statement and evaluate.  If it is true it will execute the first code.  If it is false it will continue evaluating each condition until it is true.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* You can use logical operators  like && or || that can compare a conditional relationship between multiple variables of values.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* I think getting functions to work and how to structure them.  I get it but I need more practice and exposure before I feel comfortable.
