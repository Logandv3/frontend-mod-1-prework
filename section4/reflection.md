## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

`I was actually already using the Pomodoro method on and off so it wasn't too hard to get used to`

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

`I had not been setting goals and intentions at the beginning of my sessions until this section.  I wasn't very good at it starting out, but I got a bit better.  I started looking forward a lot more and it gave me a good idea of what I needed to do and what was manageable for the near future.`

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

`An object allows us to create something that has certain properties.  We can create many of those similar objects with the same properties, but we can assign different values and methods to them.  So we don't have to keep going back and building the same thing over and over.  We can just build a new variable and call on and change the properties and methods.  An array holds things as well, but is not as versatile in what it can do or how easy it is to use.`

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class `array`
  * List of states and their capitals `object`
  * List of things to pack for vacation `array`
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow `array`
  * List of student names and their cohort `object`
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake `object`
  * All my favorite restaurants `array`

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

`A ski app will log your time on the mountain into different runs and trips up the mountain.  It tracks speed, elevation gain/loss, temperature, how long you spend standing in line and time spent on the lift.`

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
